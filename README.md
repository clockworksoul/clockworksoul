### 🔭  My current project

I’m currently working on my first book: [Cloud Native Go](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/cloud-native-go/9781492076322/) (O'Reilly Media). Its first few chapters are available now in Early Release, so feel free to go ahead and take a look. If you have thoughts about how I can improve the work, I want to hear them!

### ⚡ Fun facts

- I have above average handwriting.
- I have [a repository to record things I learned or just want to make sure I remember](https://github.com/clockworksoul/today-i-learned/blob/main/README.md). I've been neglecting it recently though.
- My hobbies include spontaneous human combustion, collecting dirt, and cold logic.
- My turnoffs include time, object permanence, barium, and four out of five dentists.

### 📫  How to reach me

I've been off of most social media for the last couple of years, which while liberating, can also make it harder to get in touch with me. However...

* I'm [still on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-titmus/).
* I can still be reach by good old-fashioned email at [matthew.titmus@gmail.com](mailto://matthew.titmus@gmail.com).
