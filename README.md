### ðŸ”­ My current project

I'm currently working on the second edition of my book, [Cloud Native Go](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/cloud-native-go/9781492076322/) (O'Reilly Media). The first edition is already available on the O'Reilly Learning Platform and for purchase [on Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/Cloud-Native-Go-Unreliable-Environments/dp/1492076333/ref=sr_1_5). Please feel free to go ahead and take a look, and if you have thoughts about how I can improve it, I want to hear them!

### âš¡ Fun facts

- I have above average handwriting.
- I have [a repository to record things I learned or just want to make sure I remember](https://github.com/clockworksoul/today-i-learned/blob/main/README.md). I've been neglecting it recently though.
- My hobbies include spontaneous human combustion, collecting dirt, and cold logic.
- My turnoffs include time, object permanence, barium, and four out of five dentists.

### ðŸ“« How to reach me

I've been off of most social media for the last couple of years, which while liberating, can also make it harder to get in touch with me. However...

* I'm [still on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-titmus/).
* I can still be reached by good old-fashioned email at [matthew.titmus@gmail.com](mailto://matthew.titmus@gmail.com).
* I have an open office hours. [Sign up here](https://calendly.com/matthew-titmus).
